# Welcome to the 1.2.0 version

Written by: @teixeira0x

## Note

The subtitle saving system has been updated again to implement the system of being able to edit multiple subtitles in a single project. Subtitles from projects created in previous versions will be lost. I apologize again.

## Changes
- Various interface improvements.
- Improved permission request.
- Improve subtitle import and saving.

## Additions
- Adds option to edit more than one caption in a single project.

## Fixes
- Undo & Redo.
